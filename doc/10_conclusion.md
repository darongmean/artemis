# Conclusion

If you've made it through all of these guides, you should now know how to
create an Artemis client, execute queries and mutations, and configure your
client with a network chain and local store. You should also now know how
channels work in Artemis, and how queries and updates are managed with the
local store. That covers most of what you'll use Artemis for, but there are a
few extras. Feel free to read through the next guide for some more advanced
examples, and take a look at the API docs for a full idea of the functions
available to you.

Hope you enjoy using Artemis, and please send the Workframe team feedback
and/or ideas on how to improve our library and its documentation!
